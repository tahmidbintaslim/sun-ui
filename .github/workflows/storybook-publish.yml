# Sun UI - Publish Storybook
#
# This workflow builds and publishes Storybook on every push and PR.
#
# Deployment Strategy:
# 1. Vercel (Primary) - Automatic via GitHub integration
#    - Vercel is connected to this repo and auto-deploys on push
#    - Preview URLs generated for PRs, Production for main branch
#    - URL: https://sun-ui.vercel.app (or your custom domain)
#
# 2. Chromatic (Visual Testing) - Via this workflow
#    - Publishes Storybook for visual regression testing
#    - Captures snapshots for UI review
#    - Requires CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN secret
#
# To debug test failures, see ui-tests.yml which uses SB_URL

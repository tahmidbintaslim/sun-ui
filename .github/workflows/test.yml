# Sun UI - CI Pipeline
#
# This workflow runs on every push and PR to validate code quality:
# - Unit tests for component logic
# - Storybook component tests for UI behavior
# - Linting and type checking
# - Visual regression tests via Chromatic
#
# For deployment-triggered tests with debugging links, see ui-tests.yml
